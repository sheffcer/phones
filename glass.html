<p>The latest smartphones have recently been produced with an expanded curved 2.5D screen with rounded edges. Normal screen protectors and films cannot fully protect such a screen from damage. They do not completely cover the screen surface, while its curved part leaves unprotected. Partial covering of the screen surface both reduces the protection level and spoils the device appearance.</p>
<p>In order to guarantee the protection of modern smartphones, while preserving the original design, a special screen protector, ColorWay 3D Soft Carbon Fiber Tempered Glass, was developed. </p>

<p>ЗColorWay 3D Soft Carbon Fiber Tempered Glass screen protector is a multi-layer 9H tempered glass. The screen protector is produced for a specific model of smartphone, with due consideration to all its design features. Unlike flat 2.5D glasses that do not completely cover the curved screens, 3D Soft Carbon glasses are designed for smartphones with rounded edges.</p>

<p>З3D Soft Carbon glasses have curved edges that completely follow the display shape and cover its surface. A distinctive feature of this screen protector is a two-component base consisting of tempered glass, which protects the working screen surface, and TPU film with engineering holes covering the remaining part of the smartphone front panel.</p>

<p>3D Soft Carbon Fiber Tempered Glass protects the screen of new smartphones from possible damage. The glass is totally transparent and smooth, does not affect the screen sensitivity, preserves the natural color reproduction, easily sticks, does not leave air bubbles and does not fade with time.</p>
<p>3D Soft Carbon Fiber Tempered Glass is a great option to take care of the safety of your device.</p>
<p>Recommendations. When choosing a 3D glass, please consider that due to the full screen coverage it is poorly compatible with some types of phone cases and bumpers, namely those that partially touch the screen parts. Due to the tight fit and thickness of the glass, the phone case edge can make pressure on the glass; this can release the glass fixation along the edges and cause the glass to become unstuck.</p>
